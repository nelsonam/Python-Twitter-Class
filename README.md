# Python Twitter Class
Originally a workshop at SF Python Meetup on September 16, 2015, this repo contains code and instructions to learn about how to use Python and Twitter.

## To get started: 

- Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and register a new app to get an API key. 
- Insert the API key in the specified places in the code. (You can use either the Jupyter notebook or the plain python file, whichever is easier)

## Recommended Order

It is recommended to go through the examples in this order:

- Posting a Tweet with Python: This is a very simple application to verify that the API keys work and that you can post a tweet.
- Download My Tweets: You can use this to download a subset of your (or someone else's) tweets to analyze.
- Make a Word Cloud: You can use this to make a word cloud of tweets downloaded from the previous example. 

## Required Libraries

- [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
